Locate to Listen is an Interactive Sound Map.  
The programme preserves, places and maps the sounds of Vogelsang Military Base in Zehdenick, Germany on August 26th 2020: a particularly rainy, unwelcoming, despondent Summer day.  
The rain gifted life, movement, sound, a voice to the otherwise frigid and silent abandoned structures left behind by the Soviet army's evaporation from the area in the mid 1990s.   
The Fauna which has started to reclaim the area gradually, back from human intervention, was also quiet and unseen, seeking shelter from heavy rainfall.   Equally absent were signs of human explorers venturing into the forest to explore the vestigial past, save for the recordists, aiming to capture something worthwhile stuck in the worthless situation.
Was it the rain or their unwelcome presence which had pushed absence into the space?  
Through the rainfall the vacant buildings: gymnasium, cafeteria, theatre, bunker, home, were the only sources of sound; utterings of the stories, secrets, truths and lies ones housed and hidden from curious eyes.
